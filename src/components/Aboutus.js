        <p class="aboutuscontent">Indian Institute of Technology Tirupati is the only third-generation IIT that offers a Master's program in Statistics. It is one of the few IITs with a Mathematics and Statistics program. Though Statistics and Probability are generally put under the umbrella of Mathematics, the philosophy, objectives, techniques, and outcomes of Statistics differ from those of Mathematics. Moreover, the advancements in fields like Statistical Learning (ML, DL, etc.), Clinical Trials, and Statistical Finance make Statistics the need of the hour.</p>
